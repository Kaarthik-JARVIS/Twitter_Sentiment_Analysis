To analyze public tweets about a topic using python, tweepy, textblob and to generate a pie chart using matplotlib

Step 1: Installation:

        Tweepy: tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API.
        Install it using following pip command:

        pip install tweepy

        TextBlob: textblob is the python library for processing textual data.
        Install it using following pip command:

        pip install textblob

        Also, we need to install some NLTK corpora using following command:
