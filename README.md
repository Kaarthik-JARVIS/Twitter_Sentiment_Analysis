# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
To analyze public tweets about a topic using python, tweepy, textblob and to generate a pie chart using matplotlib

Step 1: Installation of the required packages

        Tweepy: tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API, install it using following pip command:
     
        pip install tweepy

        TextBlob: textblob is the python library for processing textual data, install it using following pip command:

        pip install textblob

        Also, we need to install some NLTK corpora using following command:

        python -m textblob.download_corpora

        (Corpora is nothing but a large and structured set of texts.)
